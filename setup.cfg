# But this catches networkx.testing and declares it as a test module, even
# though it is not a test module.  This causes a very small discrepancy between
# the coverage report as generated by nosetests, and the coverage report as
# generated by: coverage report.  If we want them to agree, then we need to
# make sure that networkx.testing is not captured by the default match regex.
#
# Default is: (?:^|[\b_\./-])[Tt]est

match=(?:^|[\b_\./-])[Tt]est(?!ing)
